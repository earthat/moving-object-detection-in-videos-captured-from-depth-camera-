# moving-object-detection-in-videos-captured-from-depth-camera-
The algorithm for moving object tracking is based on the uploaded paper. The input feed is recorded from depth camera which differs form RGB video. Though fortunately we still have three frames in this input, so it gives good results in tracking in presnece of lot of noise.

The feed can be downloaded from here https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmzbgm7l2vudyik/1.mp4?dl=0
